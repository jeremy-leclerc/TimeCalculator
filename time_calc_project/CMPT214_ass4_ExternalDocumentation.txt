---------------------------------------

How to execute:

the calculator project can be executed from the LINIX/UNIX command line. Its pattern of use is:

	calculator conv time 
	calculator {add,subt,comp} time1 time2

time, time1, and time2 are "time values". A time value is a number of seconds or a "time spec". A time spec is a string in the form:

	n1y n2n n3d n4h n5m n6s
	where, n1 < 100, n2 < 12, n3 < 31, n4 < 24, n5 < 60, n6 < 60

n1-n6 are unsigned integers. The amount of white space between fields of the time spec are arbitrary.

time_calc can perform five commands based on a "command keyword" given as the first argument:

	- convert between a number of seconds and a time spec (conv command);
	- add two time values and output the result as a time spec (add command);
	- subtract two time values (i.e. time1 âˆ’ time2) and output the result as a time spec (subt command); and
	- compare two time values and output a result string (comp command).
	- issue a help or usage message (help command).

Time must be < 3155760000 or 99y11n30d10h30m00s

the project can be executed from the command line with the following commands. (must be in a directory with the project files):

#Create executable file
make -f makefile calculator

#execute file
./calculator [command] [argument(s)]


Design decisions:

The orginal time_calc.c file (from assignment 3) was split up among the following files:
	
	seconds.c
	seconds.h
	time_arg.c
	time_arg.h
	time_calc.c
	time_calc.h
	time_spec.c
	time_spec.h

time_calc.c: contains the main() function and deals with the io of the 	program, as well as calling the functions to execute the given command.

time_calc.h: declaration of types, functions, and constants that are needed for time_calc.c or any content that needs to be known across many modules.


time_spec.c: Deals with converting string into a time spec

time_spec.h: declaration of types, functions, and constant that are needed in time_spec.c as well as other modules

seconds.c: deals with converting string into a number of seconds

seconds.h: declaration of types, functions, and constant that are needed in seconds.c as well as other modules

time_arg.c: deals with converting time spec to seconds, and seconds to time spec

time_arg.h: declaration of types, functions, and constant that are needed in time_arg.c as well as other modules



Assumptions:
	- seconds in a minute	60
	- seconds in a hour	3600
	- seconds in a day	86400
	- days in a year	365.25
	- days in a month	30.4375
	- seconds in a month	2629800
	- seconds in a year	31557600




Limitations:
	- Seconds must be  < 3155760000
 	- Time spec must be  < 99y11n30d10h30m00s
